Black blackground, color palette.png colors, nice footer,

Translation:
"Only design changes are needed on the subpages. I'll generate the text later.
The design should be streetwear but with a modern feel.
Black color dominant, and the following colors also appear in transitions (from top left corner to bottom right corner).
Or even in a paint splatter arrangement.
This is not the final hoodie design, but roughly this hoodie should characterize our website."

Key elements to preserve from current design:
- Phone mockup aesthetic (mobile-first visual language)
- Turquoise #00b2ca as accent color (can be secondary to black)
- Playfair Display typography (sophisticated serif)
- 20px border radius, subtle shadows
- Full-height sections on desktop
- Clean spacing and modern forms

Components to keep unchanged:
- Email validation system (/validate)
- Password reset system (/reset-password) 
- Smart download redirect (/download)
- Privacy policy structure (/privacy)
- Support contact form with API integration
- Data service class (API layer)
- App store integration and download links
- Company information and social media links
- F6S awards section
- React routing system and build configuration

Focus remake efforts on:
- Home page hero and marketing sections
- Visual design with streetwear aesthetic
- Landing page content and copy
- Overall styling to match black dominant + paint splatter design
- GSAP animations (if keeping current ones)
