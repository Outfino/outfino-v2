# Step 6: Animations & Visual Effects

## üìã Objective
Add smooth animations using GSAP to make the site visually appealing with streetwear-inspired motion design.

## ‚ö° Prerequisites
- Steps 1-5 completed
- GSAP library installed
- All components and sections built

## üìù Tasks to Complete

### 6.1 Set Up GSAP
- Import GSAP and ScrollTrigger plugin
- Basic configuration for smooth animations
- Set default ease and duration values

### 6.2 Hero Section Animations

**Page Load Animations**:
- Fade in video background
- Title slides up with stagger on words
- Subtitle fades in after title
- CTA buttons slide up
- Paint blobs float continuously

**Scroll Effects**:
- Simple parallax on video
- Content fades out slightly on scroll
- Scroll indicator bounces

### 6.3 Feature Section Animations

**Scroll-Triggered**:
- Each section fades in when visible
- Content slides up from below
- Phone mockups slide in from sides
- Paint blobs scale up from 0 to full size
- Stagger animations by 0.1-0.2s for smooth flow

**Continuous Effects**:
- Phone mockups gentle floating (up and down)
- AI rings rotating at different speeds (inner fast, outer slow)
- Paint blobs morphing shapes continuously
- Particles floating around AI visualization

### 6.4 Text Effects

**Simple Animations**:
- Headlines fade in with slight movement
- Gradient text color animations
- Hover effects on interactive text
- Keep it subtle and professional

### 6.5 Button Animations

**Interactions**:
- Scale on hover
- Shadow effects
- Color transitions
- Smooth and responsive

### 6.6 Paint Splatter Movement

**Organic Motion**:
- Floating animation
- Shape morphing
- Opacity pulsing
- Different speeds per blob

### 6.7 Mobile Considerations
- Reduce animations on mobile for performance
- Disable parallax on small screens
- Keep essential animations only

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- Animations are smooth
- Site looks professional and modern
- No performance issues
- Mobile experience is good
- Animations enhance the design

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Step
Once animations are ready, proceed to Step 7: Mobile Responsiveness
